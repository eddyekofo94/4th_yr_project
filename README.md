## 1. Technologies: What & Why

   * I wish to make web app (MVC) because of the highly powerful mobile devices we have now.

   * A Web app is easier to maintain.
   
   * Web apps are compatible with almost any device.
   
   * I don’t need my app to utilise any device-specific features.
   
   * My Dashboard also will be built on MVC, so I will be using C# across all my apps.
## 2. Features on the Dashboard
### Translation	
* Popular language(User may choose from 60 different languages Google Translator API provides)	 
* Days(Which the app is highly used)	
* Location (Where is the users using the app located? e.g. Dublin, Paris etc…)
* Age (Demographic)
* Length (Character count of the messages sent by users)

### Sentiment

* Happiness
* Sadness
* Which days of the week are the users most: Happy, sad (e.g. Monday morning there seems be angry users)
* Which demographic are in which mood in different times of the day, week, year etc…
* During a certain events(World Cup, Olympics etc..) which users express a different type of emotion.

## 3. Privacy

The users’ data will not be stored on the servers, unless the user wishes to “backup” his/her chat.

Only the user’s credentials such as username, password, location, DOB etc… will be stored and the right encryption will be used for the 		appropriate 	security measures.
