##1. Technologies: What & Why
   * I wish to make web app (MVC) because of the highly powerful mobile devices we have now.
   * A Web app is easier to maintain.
   * Web apps are compatible with almost any device.
   * I don’t need my app to utilise any device-specific features.
     * My Dashboard also will be built on MVC, so I will be using C# across all my apps.
##2. Features on the Dashboard
___
###Translation	
* Popular language(User may choose from 60 different languages Microsoft Translator API provides)	 
* Days(Which the app is highly used)	
* Location (Where is the users using the app located? e.g. Dublin, Paris etc…)
* Age (Demographic)
* Length (Character count of the messages sent by users)
---
###Sentiment
* Happiness
* Sadness
* Which days of the week are the users most: Happy, sad (e.g. Monday morning there seems be angry users)
* Which demographic are in which mood in different times of the day, week, year etc…
* During a certain events(World Cup, Olympics etc..) which users express a different type of emotion.

##3. Privacy
The users’ data will not be stored on the servers, unless the user wishes to “backup” his/her chat. This practice has been imitated my the 
messenger giant What’s app the stated the following:
“_We believe that your chats are very important, and we work hard to make sure that you never lose them. 
However, in the case that they are deleted or lost for any reason, we cannot help you recover the messages 
because we do not store your WhatsApp chat history in our system._” - see WhatsApp FAQ - Recovering messages

Only the user’s credentials such as username, password, location, DOB etc… will be stored and the right encryption will be used for the 		appropriate 	security measures.
